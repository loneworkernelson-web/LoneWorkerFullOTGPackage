### **Introducing the Lone Worker On-the-Go AppSuite (OTG AppSuite)**

Protect your community-based staff and capture valuable visit data with the free, self-hosted On-the-Go AppSuite.

Designed for organizations with staff in the field, this system can be configured as a simple **Lone Worker Safety System** or a powerful **Safety & Visit Reporting Tool**, all in one free PWA.

**How It Works:**

1. **The Worker App (PWA for Smartphones):**

   * The worker uses the app to start a safety timer when they arrive on site.

   * **Simple Mode:** When finished, they tap "Depart" to safely end the timer.

   * **Advanced Mode:** When finished, they tap "Depart & File Report." A custom or standard checklist appears, allowing them to log visit details and notes.

   * The report is saved to a central Google Sheet, even if the worker is offline (it syncs later).

2. **The Monitoring Dashboard (Web App):**

   * A safety monitor has a live dashboard showing all active workers, their status, location, and battery level.

   * All safety features (Panic Button, Duress PIN, Overdue Alerts) function in real-time.

3. **Central Database (Google Sheet):**

   * All safety and (optional) visit report data is logged to your private Google Sheet.

   * **Advanced:** Administrators can define unique checklists (with headers and note fields) for different purposes or companies in a separate tab.

   * **Advanced:** Automatically generate professional PDF reports (with optional AI-powered grammar check) to track data and trends over time.

**Core Safety & Reporting Features:**

* **Full Safety Suite:** Includes Panic Button (SOS), Duress PIN, automated overdue email alerts, and optional check-ins.

* **Flexible Deployment:** Choose a simple safety-only setup or enable the full advanced reporting suite.

* **Offline Reporting:** (Advanced Mode) Workers can fill out and save their visit reports even with no internet connection.

* **Live Monitoring:** The monitor's dashboard shows all active workers, prioritized by alert status.

* **GPS & Battery Tracking:** Provides the monitor with the worker's last known phone battery level and logs GPS on alerts (requires the app to be in the foreground).
